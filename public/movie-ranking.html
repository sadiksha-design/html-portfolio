<h1>The Best series According to Sadiksha</h1>
<h2>My top 3 series of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>DEATH NOTE</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime. . The animation and art style are consistent throughout, keeping you engrossed right the way through to its satisfying conclusion.</p>
<h3>ALL OF US ARE DEAD</h3>
<p>It's clever, thrilling, and also... a bit exhausting. Unfolding over 12 solidly packed hour-long episodes, All of Us Are Dead is, not to put too fine a point on it, a lot of zombie horror..</p>
<h3>SQUID GAME</h3>
<p>Squid Game is a thriller series that depicts a deadly competition among people in debt123. the series also has sharp social commentary and a surprisingly tender core23, which makes it compelling and engaging for viewers. Squid Game has received mostly positive reviews from critics and audiences3.</p>
